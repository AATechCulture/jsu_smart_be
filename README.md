## Project Description 🤯
This application is an all-in-one platform designed to empower communities by addressing health, finances, and social engagement in an accessible and convenient manner. It features a virtual health assistant powered by advanced AI trained on medical textbooks with the RAGing methodin, financial tools to help users analyze and optimize their budgets, and an AI chatbot for on-demand support. Additionally, the community page connects users with local events and neighbors, fostering collaboration and a sense of belonging.
